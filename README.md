# b3k.me
This is where the page/contents for my b3k.me domain lives, at least right now. You can find my spin on the Matrix Rain [here](B3KtUEX.htm).
Also this domain was a bargain. My main website can be found [here](http://stgiga.github.io), and for my Neocities-styled site [here](http://stgiga.github.io). 
I do have big plans for this domain, including Fediverse as well as a Minecraft server on 1.19.0 with [UnifontEX](http://stgiga.github.io/UnifontEX) and a few other things added for QoL. Maybe I should link my current 1.17.1 server?

I'm also probably going to add some stuff like another blog and maybe a link shortener. I also plan on doing subdomain stuff, among other things.

Fun fact, I bought this domain because of a conversation with an offline friend of mine.
